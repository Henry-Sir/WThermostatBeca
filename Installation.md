YOU CAN BE ELECTROCUTED IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

Ask a professional to install the devices if you are unsure how to do or if local law or your insurance forbids you to do such works!

## 2. Remove Display-Unit
You better should remove Processor-Wifi-Unit from Relais-Body before you'are going to install.
The surface is very sensitive for scratches.

## 3. Wiring
The Images shows the GA-Version which has two relais:
1 - Relais/Output 1 (Close) is active if powered on and the the room temperature is warm enough so the valve should close
2 - Relais/Output 2 (Open) is active if powered on and the the room temperature is to cold so the valve should open to heat the room

Often you only need Output 2 (Open) and Input 3 (N) and 4 (L)
