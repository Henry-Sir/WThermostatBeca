# Installation

Here a quick overview of  installing the Beca/Moes thermostat harware.

For Software installation see [Flasing.md](Flasing.md) and [Configuration.md](Configuration.md).

## ATTENTION

:warning: The devices are running at 115/230 Volt AC - which is highly dangerous.

YOU CAN BE ELECTROCUTED IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

Ask a professional to install the devices if you are unsure how to do or if local law or your insurance forbids you to do such works!

## 2. Remove Display-Unit

You better should remove Processor-WiFi-Unit from Relays-Body before you'are going to install.
The surface is very sensitive for scratches.

## 3. Wiring

The Images shows the GA-Version which has two Relays:
1 - Relays/Output 1 (Close) is active if powered on and the room temperature is warm enough so the valve should close
2 - Relays/Output 2 (Open) is active if powered on and the room temperature is to cold so the valve should open to heat the room

Often you only need Output 2 (Open) and Input 3 (N) and 4 (L)
